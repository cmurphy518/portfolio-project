<h2>List of my current Projects</h2>
<div class="column">
  <h3>My First Webpage</h3>
  <p>This was my first project where I worked on multiple pages like my favorite things along with my first webpage. This was to learn how to add images, make lists, and changing styling on the page. You can check this out <a href="https://github.com/cmurphy518/my-first-webpage.git">here</a></p>

  <h3>Favorite Band</h3>
  <p>Alex and I created a webpage on my favorite band the XX. This was to practice using floats. We made it so the image will wrap around text and created a sidebar of text on the right of the page. You can check this out <a href="https://github.com/cmurphy518/favorite-band.git">here</a> </p>

<div class="column">
  <h3>Vacation</h3>
  <p>I created a webpage for my dream vacation to Maldives. This was to help practice Bootstrap. I was able to interact with how Bootstrap will automatically add styling to the page. You can check this out <a href="https://github.com/cmurphy518/vacation-bootstrap.git">here</a></p>
